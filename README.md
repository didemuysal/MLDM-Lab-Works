# Machine Learning and Data Mining Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating the implementation of various machine learning algorithms. The projects cover fundamental concepts in classification, neural networks, and clustering using popular Python libraries.

## Projects
This repository includes the following projects:

1. Bayesian Learning and Text Classification
An exploration of Bayesian learning principles applied to a text classification task. This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a probabilistic model for categorizing text data.

2. Decision Tree Classifiers
Decision Tree classifier with Iris Dataset.ipynb and Decision Trees on Breast Cancer Data.ipynb
These notebooks implement Decision Tree classifiers on the classic Iris and Breast Cancer datasets. They cover the process of building, visualizing, and evaluating decision tree models for classification.

3. Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
An implementation of the Perceptron algorithm and a Multi-Layer Perceptron from scratch. This project showcases the foundational concepts of neural networks.

4. SVM and Clustering for Digit Recognition
This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and clustering algorithms for unsupervised learning on the handwritten digits dataset.

5. Relational Learning Performance Comparison
A notebook that delves into relational learning models and compares their performance on a relational dataset.
